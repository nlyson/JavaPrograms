/*
  Program Name: Changpu.java Test Input File: changpu.dat Changpu has just learned about numbers and their complements, 
  especially since a complement is slightly different than the opposite of a number. 
  
  He decides to write a simple program to test his newfound knowledge, but needs a little help. For fun, he wants to take any number, 
  negative or non-negative, and print its complement if it is even, otherwise just print its opposite value if it is odd. For example, the values 0 and -1 are complement values. So are 1 and -2, 2 and -3, 3 and -4, and so on. Opposites are different. The opposite of 1 is -1, 2â€™s opposite is -2, and so on. Input: A series of two-digit integers, all on one line, with single space separation. Output: For each input integer N, if it is even, print N and its complement value, otherwise print N and its opposite value, with single space separation.
  
  Sample Input:
  83 -70 81 -13 51
  
  Sample Output:
  83 -83
  -70 69
  81 -81
  -13 13
  51 -51
